# cc-bridge

A Claude Code ↔ Telegram bridge. Drive a Claude Code session from Telegram — send messages and
files, get replies with native formatting, approve permission prompts with a tap, switch modes,
watch a live activity feed, and interrupt a task. It ships built-in access control (pairing,
allowlists, group policy).

Its **off-MCP mode** runs your *work* sessions plugin-less (no per-request MCP context tax):
inbound is typed into the session's tmux pane, replies are read back from the transcript, and a
`tg` CLI handles file-send / react / edit / progress. The daemon **auto-discovers** the
plugin-less pane — no manual pinning.

## 👉 If the user wants to install / set up / configure this
Follow **[`off-mcp/INSTALL.md`](off-mcp/INSTALL.md)** step by step — it is written for *you*
(an agent) to execute. In short:
1. **Interview the user first** (bot token from @BotFather, their Telegram numeric ID, voice
   transcription, render-Markdown) and write `~/.claude/channels/telegram/.env`
   + `access.json` — before anything restarts.
2. Add the marketplace + enable the plugin + add the `SessionStart` daemon hook in
   `~/.claude/settings.json`, and append `off-mcp/CLAUDE.md` to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`.
3. Have the user restart Claude Code once → the daemon comes up fully configured.
4. Launch a bridge session with `cc-bridge` (auto-added shell function, `scripts/setup-alias.sh`;
   `claude-tg` is a kept back-compat alias for it): `cc-bridge [--pin slack|discord] [slot] [account]` sets
   the per-channel tmux pane markers `@telegram`/`@slack`/`@discord` (valued by instance slot; a
   `--pin slack|discord` flag additionally stamps that channel's pin option), optionally launches
   under `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR="$HOME/.claude-<account>"`, then runs
   `claude --allow-dangerously-skip-permissions` — bypass is switchable on demand. `cc-bridge 2` routes to
   a second bridge (multi-instance: `off-mcp/INSTALL.md`) — the daemon finds the pane automatically.

Don't guess config values — ask. The only non-automatable bits are getting the token from the
human and the one Claude Code restart; do everything else yourself.

This repo is now a 3-channel marketplace (Telegram/Slack/Discord — see `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`,
`plugins/claude-slack/`, `plugins/claude-discord/`), sharing a `ChannelAdapter` contract in `channel.ts`;
see `docs/multi-channel.md` for how the channels plug in.

## Layout (for working on the repo)
- `daemon.ts` (Telegram) / `slack-daemon.ts` / `discord-daemon.ts` — the long-lived bot + access gate
  + tmux pane driver + off-MCP outbound, per channel (the bulk of the code).
- `topics.ts` (pure session<->topic store) + `topic-runtime.ts` (forum-topics live half: pane
  session identity, topic lifecycle, per-topic typing, outbound routing).
- `shim.ts` — the MCP server; used only in plugin/MCP mode (off-MCP bypasses it).
- `transcript.ts` — off-MCP outbound: read replies + activity from Claude Code's transcript JSONL.
- `tgctl.ts` — the `tg` actions CLI; `ensure-daemon.ts` — standalone daemon relauncher.
- `prompt.ts` — detect interactive prompts (select / permission) from a pane capture.
- `common.ts` (shared types/paths), `markdown.ts` (Markdown → Telegram HTML).
- `off-mcp/INSTALL.md` (setup) + `off-mcp/CLAUDE.md` (the convention every plugin-less session reads).
- `off-mcp/CHAT-DM.md` + `off-mcp/chat-account/` (templates) — optional claude.ai-style chat agent living in the bot's DM (auto-provisioned once a group is bound).
- `ACCESS.md` (access control), `TESTING.md`, `docs/fleet-verification.md` (how to verify bus/fleet
  changes live — spawn-a-throwaway recipe, the traps, and what is NOT yet verified).

**Repo perms (group-shared checkouts).** If this tree is shared by more than one account, keep it
group-writable — **setgid, group-writable dirs (2775)**, **umask 002**, and **`git config
core.sharedRepository=group`** — so normal file creation lands group-writable (664). The ONE thing
that breaks this: **never `chmod` tracked files to owner-only/read-only modes (600/444/464)** —
collaborators then can't read them and `bun run deploy` aborts copying the unreadable ones (the
`assets/claude.jpg` failure that has bitten before). If perms ever drift, fix it in one shot:
**`sudo bash scripts/fix-perms.sh`** (idempotent; ownership is left alone, group perms grant the
access).

**Deploy loop** (the live daemon runs from the plugin cache, not this checkout): edit `.ts` here →
**`bun run deploy [patch|minor|major|x.y.z]`** (default `patch`) → test live → commit. The script
(`scripts/deploy.ts`) does the whole ritual atomically: bumps `version` in both
`.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `marketplace.json`, syncs the git-tracked files into the cache
(`~/.claude/plugins/cache/cc-bridge/telegram/<ver>/`) + the marketplace mirror,
installs deps if missing, type-checks in the cache (`bun build daemon.ts --target=bun` — grammy
resolves only there), then restarts the daemon (the watchdog/SessionStart hook respawns it from the
newest cache version) and verifies it came back on the new version. The type-check runs **before**
the checkout's version files are stamped, so a failed build never dirties the working tree. Flags:
`--no-restart` (ship to cache without touching the live daemon) and `--commit "msg"` (commit + push
after a clean deploy). Commits end with `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.8 <noreply@anthropic.com>`.

Doing it by hand (only if the script can't run): copy the changed `.ts` to the cache `<ver>` dir +
the marketplace dir → `bun build daemon.ts --target=bun` to type-check → restart the daemon
(`kill "$(cat ~/.claude/channels/telegram/daemon.pid)"`; the watchdog / SessionStart hook respawns
it) → test, then bump the version (next paragraph) and commit.

**Releasing (so end-user installs actually get the change) — DON'T SKIP:** the plugin cache is
**keyed by the version string**. If you ship code without bumping `version` in **both**
`.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, every existing install keeps
running its cached old build forever (Claude Code sees "version already installed" and never
re-copies, even after the marketplace pulls your new HEAD). So **bump the version on every shipped
change**, then push. `bun run deploy` does this bump for you (both files); if you ever ship by hand,
do it yourself. End-users upgrading a same-version cache must force-refresh (see
`off-mcp/INSTALL.md` §0.6).

**One repo — `origin` → `casualsav/cc-bridge`:** this is both the source of truth and the marketplace
that end-user installs pull from, so a plain `git push` (which `bun run deploy --commit` runs) both
ships the code and releases it. No mirror, no dual-push — there is no second repo in the loop.

**The cache needs deps, not just `.ts`.** A fresh cache copy is often only the `.ts` files — no
`package.json`/`bun.lock`/`node_modules` — so `bun daemon.ts` floats grammy to a build that crashes
with `EACCES … resolving 'debug'`. `ensure-daemon.ts` self-heals (writes a pinned `package.json` +
`bun install` before launch), and `bun run deploy` seeds a fresh `<ver>` cache by cloning the
newest existing version dir (carrying `node_modules`/`bun.lock`) — but when hand-copying to a cache
dir, also copy `package.json` + `bun.lock` and run `bun install` there so grammy pins to **1.41.1**.
Keep the grammy version pinned in `package.json`, in `ensure-daemon.ts`'s generated manifest, and in
`scripts/deploy.ts`'s `GRAMMY_PIN` in sync.

## ⚠️ This checkout is shared by concurrent agent sessions

More than one Claude Code session works in this directory at once. **Another session's uncommitted
work is sitting in the tree next to yours, and it is not yours to move.** This is not etiquette —
it is the rule that a `git stash -u` broke on 2026-07-25, temporarily removing ~50 uncommitted lines
of a sibling session's in-flight fix while chasing an unrelated test discrepancy.

**Explicit paths on every git verb, not just commits.** `git add file.ts`, never `git add -A`.

**Never run a whole-tree operation:** `git stash`, `git reset --hard`, `git checkout .`,
`git restore .`, `git clean`, `git add -A`, or a bare `git checkout <branch>` / `git switch`
(switching branches rewrites the tree under everyone standing in it).

- **To compare against HEAD:** `git show HEAD:file.ts > /tmp/old.ts` — never stash to "see the
  before". That is what caused the incident.
- **To undo your own change:** `git checkout HEAD -- path/you/own.ts`, path-scoped.
- **If you genuinely need a clean tree:** ask the orchestrator to sequence it. Do not take one.
- **Before a git verb, check who else is here:** `git status` — treat files you did not touch as
  someone's live work, and leave them alone.

### Recovering work that disappeared

The working tree is snapshotted to hidden refs under `refs/cc-bridge/autosave/`, including
**untracked** files. Nothing is lost as easily as it looks:

```
bun autosave.ts list                      # every snapshot, newest first
bun autosave.ts show <ref>                # what changed in one
bun autosave.ts restore <ref> <path>...   # write those paths back (explicit paths only)
```

Snapshots are ordinary commits, so `git show <ref>:<path>` works too. They are built in a throwaway
index and never touch your working tree, index or stash. Retained 7 days.

### The guard

`scripts/session-guard.ts` is a `PreToolUse` hook that refuses the whole-tree verbs above **when
another bridged session is live in this directory** (detected from `@tg_session` tmux pane stamps),
after snapshotting first. It fails open — if anything about the hook errors, your command runs.
Override for a case you are certain about: `CC_BRIDGE_ALLOW_TREE_OPS=1 <command>`.

Enable it per-checkout by registering the hook in `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{ "hooks": { "PreToolUse": [ { "matcher": "Bash",
  "hooks": [ { "type": "command", "command": "bun scripts/session-guard.ts" } ] } ] } }
```

Snapshots are pruned on two bounds, whichever binds first: **7 days** old, or more than **1000**
refs. Either alone fails — age alone lets a hard day accumulate thousands, a count alone silently
drops this morning's during a busy stretch.

### What `bun run deploy` actually ships — everyone gets this wrong the same way

It takes the file **LIST** from `git ls-files` (tracked files only) and the file **CONTENT** from
`copyFileSync` off the **working tree**. There is no `git archive`, `git show` or `checkout-index`
anywhere in `scripts/deploy.ts`. So:

- **Untracked files never ship**, however dirty the tree is. A new file you have not `git add`ed is
  structurally invisible to a deploy.
- **Tracked files ship whatever is in the working tree right now**, committed or not. A sibling
  session's uncommitted edit to a tracked file *will* go out inside your deploy.

Do not reason about this as "it deploys the commit" — it does not. That asymmetry is why the deploy
warns about uncommitted payload files, and why "commit first" matters for *tracked* files specifically.

`bun run deploy` also refuses to ship from any branch but `main`. To ship a branch deliberately you
must **name** it: `bun run deploy --ship-branch <branch>`. There is no bare `--force`, on purpose —
a habitual flag is one people type without reading. `--commit` stages only the version files it owns,
never `git add -A`.
